.NET Game - Learning Project
This repository contains a simple .NET game project that I started during my C# course. The goal was to learn and apply the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) while building a basic game using .NET technologies.

Current Progress
Basic game structure implemented
Core classes and logic included
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
Encapsulation

Implemented in the Player class, where attributes like health, score, and name are protected and accessible only through public methods.
Inheritance

Demonstrated through the Warrior class inheriting basic features from the Character class.
Polymorphism

Showcased in the Program class, which uses a common interface for various character classes. Each character class, such as Warrior, Knight, Assassin, Mage, Necromancer, and Druid, inherits from the base Character class and overrides the Attack() method to provide unique behavior.
